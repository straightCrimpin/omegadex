<h2>Paragons!</h2>

Paragons are an essential part of dino progression. A Paragon is another stat multiplier added to dinos to greatly increase their overall strength. Each Paragon level
provides a 100% increase to base stats. This is multiplied by the tier multiplier as well. They're unlocked through various methods, but mainly through feeding your tame a
Paragon Soul matching it's species, or by completeing the paragon quests which can be viewed by opening up the multiuse wheel on your tame and selecting the Paragon
icon. When Paragons are applied to your tame, the stats are completely recalculated. There isn't any specific order that they need to be added or completed because of
this.

<br><h4>Dino stats are calculated as:</h4>

- Base Stats x Tier Multiplier X (Paragon Level + 1)
- So if your tame has 1500 health, is Elite tier, and has 12 paragons applied, this would be:
- 1500 x 32 x 13 = 624,000 health.
