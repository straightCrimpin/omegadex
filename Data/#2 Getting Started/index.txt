<h3>Getting Started (Things You Must Know)</h3>

So you've just started playing, and don't know where to begin. First off, there will be many new and dangerous creatures wandering around and you may not know how to
get started taming them.

1. The first goal should be to craft an Omega Workbench. This contains most of the items specific to Ark Omega. This includes custom equipment, potions, tranqs, and
structures.

2. Begin gathering souls and essence. These are rewarded to all players in the area when a wild dino is killed. You will get 1 soul corresponding to the group of the killed
dino, plus 5 essence corresponding to the tier, Wild dinos will NOT reward souls and essence if knocked out before being killed. Souls and essence are used to craft nearly
every item in Ark Omega.

3. Use your souls and essence to craft the custom weapons in the Omega Workbench. The Multi-Tool acts as an upgrade to the gathering tool, acting as pickaxe, hatchet,
club and sickle all in one.

4. Next step is to craft a kibble station, used to craft every kibble in Ark Omega.

5. You should begin by taming vanilla dinos for generic eggs required for basic kibbles, followed by basic tier dinos of each group to begin progression through the tiers.
All dinos require mate boost to lay eggs when outside of an egg collector, with a more detailed explanation in the progression guide.

6. After these steps are complete, the progression guide tab is crucial to understanding Ark Omegas more complex features.
