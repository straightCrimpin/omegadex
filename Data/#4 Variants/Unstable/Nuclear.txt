<span style="color:orange;">Nuclear</span>: The 7th Variant of Unstable. Similar to Meltdown, this allows you to sacrifice
some of your own health to build up damage. But things here are a bit more interesting.
Releasing the ability key, or reaching the limit, causes an explosion which deals a great
deal of damage over a great area. This is the largest AOE attack in Ark Omega, and one of
the highest damage multipliers, but use it carefully.

Holding Prone(X) will force you into Nuclear Meltdown mode. You will lose health in
Nuclear Meltdown mode, and the rate at which health is lost will speed up the longer you
are in Meltdown, but the damage also increases the longer you are in Meltdown.
