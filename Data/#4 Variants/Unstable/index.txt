<span style="color:orange;">UNSTABLE</span>:
Unstable creatures are as they sound, unstable. Without a moments notice, they could
explode or erupt into powerful clouds and devistate would-be attackers. Unstable creatures
can be unpredictible in fights, sometimes even riding the edge of death to deal the most
damage. They are some of the more common massive AOE damage dealers you'll find.
