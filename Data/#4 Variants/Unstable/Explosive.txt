<span style="color:orange;">Explosive</span>: As it sounds, these creatures can cause powerful explosions at any minute. Both
while attacking or being attacked, these explosions may trigger doing damage over a large
area as if a Grenade has gone off. Its best to avoid them unless prepared, as the explosion
damage can destroy most structures as well.

Pressing Prone(X) will release an explosion, as if caused by C4 or a large grenade. The
closer to the source, the higher the damage.
