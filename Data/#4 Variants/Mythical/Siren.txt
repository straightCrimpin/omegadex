<span style="color:lightgreen;">Siren</span>: These possess the ability to lull enemies into a completely passive state, forcing
them to wander towards the music they hear. Siren's are capable of making even the most
powerful of bosses go completely passive, wandering towards the Siren completely
unaware of its own demise, ignoring all damage dealt to it in the meantime. If your tame is
hit by a siren while you are mounted, you will lose control and be powerless to control your
dino as it wanders towards the Siren.

Pressing Prone(X) will make the Siren play a sound, making all creatures in the area go
completely passive and wander towards it. They will not react to damage during this time.
