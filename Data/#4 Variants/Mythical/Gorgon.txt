<span style="color:lightgreen;">Gorgon</span>: Like Medusa, one quick gaze from these creatures will cause you to turn to stone.
Stoned creatures will be completely incapable of movement for a short time. Also, while
turned to stone, creatures will take triple damage from any Gorgon that attacks it.

Pressing Prone(X) will instantly turn any enemy to stone caught within a cone in front of the
Gorgon.
