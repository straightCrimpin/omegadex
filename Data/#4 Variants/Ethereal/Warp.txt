<span style="color:lightgray;">Warp</span>: Similar to the Shadowmane's teleport attack, the Warp ability will teleport you
between nearby enemies dealing damage to them. You can quickly attack many targets in
succession, sometimes travelling a great distance while doing so. Unfortunately, you have
no control over which targets are chosen.
Pressing Prone(X) gets the nearest valid target to the Warp creature, teleporting you to it to
deal damage before choosing another nearby target to continue. If a separate valid target is
not found, the Warp is over.
