<span style="color:yellow;">Paragon</span>: Paragon creatures are greatly prized for their souls. When a Paragon creature is
killed, it drops a soul based on its species. Feeding this soul to a creature of the same
species will reward it a Paragon level, giving a permanent 100% stat increase, up to a
Paragon level of 10. These are displayed on your tames name in Roman Numerals, with 10
being [X]. Because of this incredible power, Paragon creatures always spawn at Paragon [X],
and are much harder to kill.

Paragon creatures can only be tamed using Unique Kibble.
