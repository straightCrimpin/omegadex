<span style="color:yellow;">Essence</span>: Often called "gummy" because of their appearance, these creatures are made of
100% pure Essence. Being made of such a fluid substance also means they take
considerably less damage. When killed, they reward a huge cache of Essence based on their
Tier. The number of essences dropped it based on the number of kibble it would normally
require to tame that creature, so taming speed will have an effect on the number of
essences dropped.

Essence creatures can only be tamed using Unique Kibble.
