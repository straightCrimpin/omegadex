<span style="color:brown;">Potion</span>: The 7th Variant of Utility. One of the most useful variants of all, Potion creatures
are capable of feeding potions from their inventory to nearby players and tames to restore
their health and stamina. The wheel can be used to set a health %, and anytime a nearby
player or tame gets below that health %, they will have health potions and/or stamina
potions fed to them. The maximum tier of potion that can be fed is limited to the tier of the
Potion dino.

Only one potion type can be automatically fed at a time to your tames through a potion
dino, so make sure to keep the highest tier health and stamina potions that it is capable of
feeding.

Endless tier can feed Godlike potions.

-----
Must put health/stamina potions into the Potion creature's inventory.

Health % to start feeding potions adjustable via wheel.
