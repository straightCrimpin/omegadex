<span style="color:brown;">Crafting</span>: Crafting creatures provide a much needed service. They have a crafting tab in
their inventory that contains nearly all engrams for everything in the Smithy, Fabricator, and
Omega Workbench. They also get a huge boost to crafting speed based on their tier,
meaning they can be used to bypass the Omega Workbench later in the game and craft all
of your items at rapid speed.
