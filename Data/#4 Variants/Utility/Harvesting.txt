<span style="color:brown;">Harvesting</span>: Harvesting creatures are able to harvest anything in sight. Even a Harvesting
Rex can harvest stone, wood, and berries. They're meant to make gathering extremely quick
and easy, reducing the need to boost harvesting rates (which would just obselete this
variant).

Pressing Prone(X) does an area attack that harvests all nearby resources.
