<span style="color:black;">Stalker</span>: Not something you want to think about following you, the Stalker will often cloak
itself while in pursuit. While cloaked, it will not be targeted by enemies, and will uncloak on
attack, landing a powerful critical hit.

Pressing Prone(X) toggle the Stalker's cloak, allowing it to go on a hunt. Being cloaked will
drain stamina, uncloaking when it is gone. If the Stalker finds a target and attacks while
cloaked, it will deal massive bonus critical hit damage, also triggering the cooldown before
it can cloak again.
