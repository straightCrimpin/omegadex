<span style="color:black;">Ghost</span>: Hidden at night, terrifying at night. Ghost creatures are completely invisible during
the day. You can walk right through them without knowing they are there, and they are
unable to attack or be ridden during the day.

At night, they are the most powerful of Nightmare creatures. No special abilities, but
exponentially more powerful with both increased health and damage, and a Dodge chance
which prevents them from being hit.
