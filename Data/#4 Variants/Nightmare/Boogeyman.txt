<span style="color:black;">Boogeyman</span>: Ruler of the night, the Boogeyman is an absolute force to be reckoned with.
A fairly normal creature during the day, at night they become covered in a solid black
cloak, unable to be targeted by other creatures. At night, they also gain huge damage
reduction, night vision, and the ability to jump-scare enemies with a powerful roar.

Pressing Prone(X) will make the Boogeyman release a terrifying Roar. This will do huge
damage to the enemies, as if scaring the life out of them. It will also force them to flee for
an extended period.
Nightmare Vision at Night Time.
