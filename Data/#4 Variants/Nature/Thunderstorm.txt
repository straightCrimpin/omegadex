<span style="color:green;">Thunderstorm</span>: The name Thunderstorm might be a bit misleading. There are definitely
lightning strikes. When Thunderstorm is activated, a powerful lightning bolt will strike one
nearby enemy every second, dealing high impact damage, and spreading a static
discharge in the area that deals tick damage to everything caught in it. The ability doesn't
need to be aimed, as the lightning strikes seek out their targets, hitting without fail. This
can be an amazing ability to use while fleeing or kiting enemies, as the lightning damage
also causes electrocution, temporarily pausing their movement.

Pressing Prone(X) creates a powerful thunderstorm that strikes a random enemy within
the radius each second, dealing strike damage but also creating an AOE static field that
does tick damage. Lightning strikes ground flyers.
