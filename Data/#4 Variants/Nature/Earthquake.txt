<span style="color:green;">Earthquake</span>: The 7th Variant of Nature. Creating an Earthquake has a lot of effects, from a
screenshaking quake that applies stun, to all 6 Nature damage types spewing from the
fissures in the ground directly on all enemies caught in the Earthquake. While it has
minimal effect on flying enemies, it can be very damaging to ground based tames.

Pressing Prone(X) causes the ground to shake, stunning all enemies in the quake radius
and creating a fissure at the base of each ground dino in the fissure, dealing a random
Nature damage type.
