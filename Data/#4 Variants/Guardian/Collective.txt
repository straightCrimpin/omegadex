<span style="color:gray;">Collective</span>: Collective creatures serve many purposes. The main one being to punish
damage dealers with their own damage. A collective dino is capable of going temporarily
immortal, gathering and biding all damage taken over a short period, before exploding it
back out evenly amongst all nearby enemies. Even weaker collective creature are
temporarily immortal to bosses, making them cheap expendable ways of punishing high
damage creatures.

Pressing Prone(X) will activate the Collective ability, making the creature immune to all
incoming damage for a period. The damage will add over the duration, and on deactivation
will be exploded back outwards, divided up evenly amongst enemies. If there is only 1
enemy, it will take the full collected damage. If there are 10, they will each take 10% of the
collected damage.
