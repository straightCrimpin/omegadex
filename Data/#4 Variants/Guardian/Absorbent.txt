<span style="color:gray;">Absorbent</span>: Absorbent creatures are the ultimate tanks. They have a large health bonus,
and reduced damage to compensate. They protect all nearby allies within their absorbent
bubble, where all damage done to any ally is redirected to the absorbent creature. Even
players within the bubble can dismount from their tame and join the fight, completely
immune to damage. These are amazing strategy creatures, as even weaker creatures with
high damage can join into boss fights without worry of death. Stacking various potions
and high quality saddle imbues on an Absorbent dino can make sure that nothing else
takes any damage for the duration of a boss fight.

Pressing Prone(X) will toggle the Absorbent Bubble. It has no cooldown timer, but instead
drains stamina over time, so stamina potions are highly recommended as the bubble will
deactivate once stamina has been depleted. Any and all damage done to any allied
creature within the bubble will be redirected to the Absorbent.

Note: Absorbent and Guardian creatures cannot be protected by other Absorbents or
Guardians.
