<span style="color:gray;">Controller</span>: Controllers are in charge of aggression levels of nearby enemies. They can
determine whether an enemy attacks or flees from the fight. They can also force enemies
to attack them specifically, drawing aggro away from allies.

Pressing Prone(X) will fear enemies in a certain range, causing them to temporarily flee
from the fight. Enemies cannot attack when fleeing.

Pressing Crouch(C) will taunt enemies, forcing them to attack the Controller instead of
other allies. They can even make most passive creatures attack them.
