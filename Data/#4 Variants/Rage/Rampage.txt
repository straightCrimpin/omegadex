<span style="color:red;">Rampage</span>: Rampage! These creatures have the ability to go on a Rampage dealing greatly
increased damage. The more they attack, the more their damage output. Stop attacking
for too long, and that bonus will start to decay away until they are back to normal damage
and no longer in a Rampage. Nearby players will know that a dino has gone into a
Rampage by the red glow on its head and the classic RAMPAGE video game sound that
plays at this time.

Pressing Prone(X) will force the creature to go into Rampage mode. This will provide a
Rampage meter, which increases with every attack, and decreases if time goes by without
dealing damage. The % displayed is how much attack damage is increased.
