<span style="color:red;">Uncontrollable</span>: The most ruthless creatures in Ark Omega. Uncontrollables have very high
stat multipliers that have no equal. They are highly aggressive, attacking any/all nearby
enemies without fear for their own life. Wild uncontrollables will actively hunt players and
tames. They are very fast, with a lot of health and damage. The name Uncontrollable comes
from the fact that once tamed, they cannot be ridden, cannot be ordered or whistled, and will
wander off to kill things while ignoring all of your commands. A powerful saddle on these
creatures turns them into a death machine, able to easily take on bosses with nothing more
than the occasional healing dart to give them a boost.
