<span style="color:red;">Frenzy</span>: Frenzy creatures make amazing allies. They have a powerful warcry that applies a
temporary boost to nearby allied creatures, increasing their damage output. While it only
lasts a short while, its enough to turn the battle when multiple creatures are used. This
effect can also stack, meaning multiple warcries are enough to turn a small group into
killing machines.

Pressing Prone(X) will cause the Frenzy creature to Warcry, increasing damage output for
all allies in the area. Can Stack up to 3 times.
