<span style="color:blue;">Singularity</span>: One of the worst things that can happen to you or your tames is being trapped
in a Singularity. When a Singularity creature summons a black hole, it can rip enemies
right up off of the ground, trapping them in the center while crushing them to death. A
singularity will even pick up fish out of the ocean, killing them. Fortunately, its also makes
for an absolutely devistating tame, as the singularity is not only able to deal great damage
to enemies, but will trap them and prevent them from moving at the same time.

Pressing Prone(X) will create a singularity in front of you. This will have a very powerful
gravity force, that will grab enemies off of the ground, sucking them in and crushing them
until the singularity is gone.
