<span style="color:blue;">Meteor</span>: Meteor creatures can call down a small meteor strike in the area. While each
individual meteor isn't particularly powerful, they hit over a large area, and larger enemies
can be striken by multiple meteors leading to incredible health loss. The number of
meteors can be random at times, as are the impact locations. Flying meteor dinos are able
to quickly swoop over an area, barrage it with meteors and fly away, making them
excellent for farming kills.

Pressing Prone(X) calls down a cluster of meteors from the sky. They will impact random
locations in the direct viscinity of the Meteor creature.
