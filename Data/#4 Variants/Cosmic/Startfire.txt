<span style="color:blue;">Starfire</span>: Starfire creatures are able to create a small star that deals insane tick damage in
an area. This star will set enemies on fire, and illuminate a massive area at night.
Nightmare creatures are often afraid of this star, making them potentially lose their night
time abilities or their willingness to attack. Starfire is one of the more powerful damage
dealers over time.

Pressing Prone(X) creates a powerful star, which illuminates a huge area at night as well as
dealing significant damage from the heat.
