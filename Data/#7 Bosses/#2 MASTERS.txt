Gods:
The Gods are powerful mid-game bosses. Meant to be the strongest of their variant, they have enhanced
versions of their abilities. It is not recommended to move into fighting Gods until you are able to farm a Prime
tier beacon boss of that variant. However with great risk, comes great reward. The Gods offer something of
great value, their soul. Unlike a Boss Soul, the God Soul has other benefits.

Summon a God by placing a Boss Soul into the God Egg. The God Egg will be unlocked when killing a beacon
boss and can be crafted in the Omega Workbench. The variant/tier of the God will match that of the Boss Soul
used to create it. Make sure you always summon a basic tier God first, before attempting to move onto the
higher tiers.

Killing a God will unlock the Omega Altar, and drop a bright shining God Soul on the ground.

You have choices from here.
1. Feed the Soul to an Omega of the same variant. This will rank it up to Godlike, doubling its stats and possibly
giving it a custom skin and version of its ability.
2. Put the Soul back into the God Egg to summon a Titan of the same tier and variant. This is mainly done to
rank up your tameable boss by giving you the titan you need.
3. Collect the souls of every variant within that group, to place in the Omega Altar to summon a Group God.
