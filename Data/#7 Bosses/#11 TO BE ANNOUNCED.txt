Titans:
Titans will spawn wild on a timer. They will first search for an Omega Beacon to spawn at. If a beacon is not
found, they will attempt to spawn near a wild Titanosaur or Gigantosaurus. These titans are not needed for
progression. Titans can be killed as part of the quest to rank up a tameable boss, or for the items that only they
have a chance of dropping. They may also unlock various vanilla Tek Engrams.

Be warned, the titans are extremely aggressive, and have a cap on how much damage they can take. They
require a minimum number of hits to be killed.
