Beacon Bosses:
These are the first group of bosses you will fight, unless you've attacked a wild Titan.
The Omega Beacon is unlocked by killing a wild Omega tier. You will unlock the Tekgram, and can craft it at the
Omega Workbench. The Omega Beacon can be used to summon wild tameable creatures, or you can place 100
souls inside to summon a Beacon Boss.
These bosses will spawn with a variant from the group of souls you have used in the beacon. These bosses
cannot be tamed. They must be killed. Killing them rewards a small amount of loot, including Element, and a
Boss Soul, which will appear as a bright glowing soul on the ground. They will also unlock various Tek Engrams,
as well as Tekgrams for Boss Kibble and the God Egg.

You have choices from here.
1. Farming bosses with 100 souls in the beacon will reward many drops, and lots of Boss Essence. Boss
Essence can be used for better imbues or crafting certain items.
2. Place the Boss Soul in the God Egg to summon the God of that variant. The tier of the god will be based on
the tier of the Boss Soul used to summon it. Be warned, Gods have 1 Ox the stats of basic tier beacon bosses,
with significantly enhanced versions of their variant's ability.
