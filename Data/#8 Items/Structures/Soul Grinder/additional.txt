The Soul Grinder is crafted in the omega workbench. It is a structure used to break down
variant souls, boss souls, master souls, and above into soul shards, and paragons into paragon
shards. Additionally, it is used to craft tier upgrade tokens for specific dino species with
essence and the species' paragon soul (for instance, a token to make a gamma dilophosaur
beta is made with one dilophosaur paragon and one hundred beta essence).
