The Cursed Idol is crafted in the omega workbench. It is a structure where you can place
imbued non-set armor to curse it. Curses include the additive curse (remove one imbue, add
three to five new ones), double curse (remove one imbue, double the stats of all the remaining
ones) and multiplier curse (multiply one imbue by up to the number of imbues on the item,
halve all the rest).
