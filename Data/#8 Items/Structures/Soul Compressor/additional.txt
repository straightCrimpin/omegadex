The Soul Compressor is crafted in the omega workbench. It is a storage container that, when
variant, boss (of every variety, masters and up included), and paragon souls are placed in it
and compressed, it removes the items from its inventory and stores them instead in a list,
from which they can be retrieved by clicking their entry.
