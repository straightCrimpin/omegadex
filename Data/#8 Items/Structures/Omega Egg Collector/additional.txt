This structure is used to integrate egg layers so that their eggs are passively produced. This
prevents a great deal of potential negative performance cases where many dinos are left out
in the world to drop eggs. Integrating a dino will permanently destroy it, but it's egg type will
be saved to the Omega Egg Collector, and it will be passively produced using standard Ark
egg laying timers, although it uses the Oviraptor boost timer. This means that each
integrated egg layer has a 13% chance to lay an egg every 11 minutes. To speed up this rate,
integrate more female egg layers. Additional things to consider: A chart of your tribe's
integrated egg layers displays on the Omegadex, the rate at which eggs are produced can be
increased in the admin panel of the Omegadex, egg generation can be disabled for individual
egg types by opening the inventory and clicking the Manage button, other Omega Egg
Collectors or Egg Collectors from my standalone mod can be combined by picking them up
and placing them in the inventory of an Omega Egg Collector, and wild female Dodos can be
integrated into the Omega Egg Collector in No-Tame.
